# MSU-WeatherAPI-Dashboard

Description:
This is a weather based website. You'll be able to search a city and it'll pull up the weather outlook for that city. It will pull up todays weather in larger text and then a 5 day forecast as well. After you search, your recent searchh will be created and populated into a recent search list. The list only shows up for tablets and computers. On phones, the list will just vanish... however, the data will still be there in local storage. 

The data resides from the OpenWeather API. It is farely easy to understand and use, especially if you use JSON to grab the data.

Technology used:

Issues: 
A lot of the OpenWeather app you have to pay for nowadays, so it's very limited on useable content.
